  abstract  = {Based on a literature review, we conceived the architecture of a spatial (& temporal) decision support system (s(t)DSS) that addresses the optimisation of the biomass-to-bioenergy supply chain logistics. In this DSS, three integrated modules will be at stake: (i) a generic and flexible database, (ii) a query tool and (iii) an optimisation tool. This paper focuses on the description of the database module, consisting of a spatial and a non-spatial component. Based on an in-depth analysis of the biomass-to-bioenergy supply process, the non-spatial data model is developed covering the types of biomass and the techniques for harvest, collection, storage, pre-treatment and conversion with their attributes on the one hand, and their mutual relationships and possible sequences on the other hand. This non-spatial data model allows the determination of all possible operation sequences from a certain biomass type to a certain conversion type within the defined biomass supply chain. The spatial component of the database module encompasses the multi-modal transportation network. Also the locations of the biomass production, storage, pre-treatment and conversion facilities are maintained in the spatial component by expanding the non-spatial component with four object types that contain the spatial characteristics (i.e. coordinates, object that actually occurs and location specific attributes) of the operation facilities.},
